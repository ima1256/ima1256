🚀 About Me

From Aerospace to Code: My journey started in aerospace engineering, dreaming about building spaceships, but I found my true calling in software 

development. I liked the idea of programming in C in our coding classes and always dreamed about programming robots or physical systems one day 

that's why after seeing some amazing boston dynamics videos picked CS my new major. 



🧠 What I Do: 

During this last years I crafted full-stack applications using technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React or Java among others. 

But after thinking about it I realized that what I enjoyed a lot in college was our time building applications 

with high level languages and also the times where I listened to the lectures of our 4 or 5 computer engineering subjects, I think I liked thos because I always 

had this tendency of asking myself why things work in the way they work. 



🌱 What I’m Learning

C and C++: Building the foundation on linux programming and networks in order to build the next generation of embeded systems one day. 

Python: Exploring more features of this high level popular language to automate my daily tasks and build fast APIs with FastAPI. 

Java: Believe it or not most of the backend systems this days specially in big corporations are built with this language so 

even though we used it a lot in collge I thought it was a great idea to dive deeper in the language.
