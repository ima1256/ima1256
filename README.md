🚀 About Me

From Aerospace to Code: My journey started in aerospace engineering, dreaming of spaceships, but I found my true calling in software 

development. I liked the idea of programming in C in our coding classes and always dreamed about coding robots or physical systems one day 

that's why after seeing some amazing boston dynamics videos picked CS as my major. 


🧠 What I Do: 

During this last years I crafted full-stack applications using technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React or Node.js among others. 

But after thinking about it I realized that what I enjoyed the most in college was not the AI classes or our time building applications 

with high level languages but actually the times where I listened to the lectures of our 4 or 5 computer engineering subjects, I always had this tendency of asking myself why things work that way.


🌱 What I’m Learning

C and C++: Building the foundation on linux programming and networks in order to build the next generation of embeded systems one day. 

Python: Exploring more features of this high level popular language to automate my daily tasks.
