🌟 Hey, I'm Imanol! 🇪🇸

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a full-stack MERN developer from Spain, living in the GMT+1 timezone, with a passion for building sleek, scalable apps and exploring the universe of code. 🚀  

🚀 About Me

From Aerospace to Code: My journey started in aerospace engineering, dreaming of spaceships, but I found my true calling in software development.  

What I Do: I craft full-stack MERN applications (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and love streaming my coding sessions live 🔴 to share the process.  

Professional Life: By day, I’m a pro developer building robust apps. By night, I dive into economics 📈, history 📚, and hit the gym 🏋️‍♂️ with XXXTentacion pumping through my headphones 🎶.


🔭 Current Projects
  

Portfolio Website: Designing a sleek personal portfolio to showcase my projects and skills.

  

Real-Time Animation App: Building an interactive app with React and ChatGPT integration for real-time animation feedback.

🌱 What I’m Learning
  

React: Leveling up my skills to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.

  

Economics: Deepening my understanding of markets and systems through books and research.

  

TypeScript: Exploring type-safe coding to enhance my MERN stack projects.
